## WIP!

`wip` is a small program I use to report the work I've done for a week. 

- I keep the work I've been doing on a [todoist][1] project named in the form `WIP - yyyy-mm-dd` (where `dd` is the first day of the week.)
- The work is separated in sections: Inbox, WIP, Done, Follow up
- I tag each task with a "topic" when I add it to the inbox
- I write some notes about the progress as comments.

When I run `wip` it generates a silly markdown report of all the work done that I can use to fill in some stuff at work :)
