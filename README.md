# WIP!

`wip` is a small program I use to report the work I've done for a week. 

- I keep the work I've been doing on a [todoist][1] project named in the form `WIP - yyyy-mm-dd` (where `dd` is the first day of the week.)
- The work is separated in sections: Inbox, WIP, Done, Follow up
- I tag each task with a "topic" when I add it to the inbox
- I write some notes about the progress as comments.

When I run `wip` it generates a silly markdown report of all the work done that I can use to fill in some stuff at work :)

## How does one use it?

You shouldn't... this is only useful for me, but if you are interested, make sure you have one (and only one) project formatted like the one explained ðŸ‘† and run it with your Todoist api token on an env variable called `TODOIST_TOKEN`.
